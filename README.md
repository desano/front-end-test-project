## Requirements
1. Create initial structure. Use gulp and node-sass. Use mobile-first approach.
2. Use HTML5 / SASS
3. Use bower as third parties lib manager
4. Create page called Home and place the elements on it
5. Use CSS3 PIE to add CSS3 support to IE8
6. Add Colorbox (http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/) as a Bower dependency and open sample photos in the news section as an image group / gallery like follows:
  * When the page loads open the first photo in colorbox automatically (without user clicking on the image).
  * Go through all 4 images in 2 seconds interval but without using a built in slideshow functionality (Hint: Check *Event Hooks* example on the Colorbox homepage.)
  * Close Colorbox when the last image from the gallery is reached.
7. Do not use bootstrap/foundation
8. Your markup should look fine on mobile devices
